Parentheses are loud !

As a spy python object, you have been sent to a remote memory location to gather information about some anonymous functions. Unfortunately, they caught wind of this and are on the lookout for any parentheses to prevent you from making any calls for help. But you are a proffesional and you don't need parentheses to make calls. Help yourself out of this situation.
Your Task

Write a code snippet that will make call to the help_me function.

Your code must NOT:

    Contain any parentheses ( or )
    Assign any variables
    Be longer than 50 characters
    Have more than 2 lines

Extra info

The help_me function is very flexible and doesn't care how may parameters you give it
