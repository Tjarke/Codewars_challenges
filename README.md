# Codewars_challenges

This repo contains my solutions to coding challenges I did on www.codewars.com . Each script will start with the description of the Task and then my solution will follow. 
The number-kyu in front indicates the difficulty rating codewars gives the challenge, where lower is more difficult.
The main aim here for me is to keep myself coding as well as finding out some new way of doing things that I did not know about before.
